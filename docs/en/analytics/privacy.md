# Homebox Privacy Policy

## Introduction

**Homebox** (and by extension; Sysadmins Media) respects the privacy of its users and is committed to protecting the data shared through our application. This privacy policy outlines the types of data collected from users who opt in to analytics, the purposes for which we collect and use this data, how it is stored, and the rights of our users under UK and US law. By opting in to data collection, you agree to the practices described in this policy. 

# 1. Data Collected

With the user's consent (opt-in analytics only), Homebox collects **anonymized** data, including:

* Homebox application version
* Operating System (OS) type and platform family
* Platform version
* Kernel architecture
* Virtualization system used
* General location data (country or region), as provided by our analytics tool, **Plausible**

Additionally, we collect default, anonymized data through Plausible, such as usage statistics, to understand how Homebox is used and to support its ongoing development. 

# 2. Data Storage and Control

All data collected through Homebox's analytics are managed and stored in our self-hosted Plausible instance. No user data resides on third-party servers or is shared outside the control of Homebox and its administrative team (Sysadmins Media). The anonymized analytics generated from this data are publicly accessible, allowing users to review the data as we do, however Homebox will at no point share (or store) any analytical data that can be used to personally identify individual users of its systems.

# 3. Data Usage

We use the collected data exclusively to improve Homebox:

* Informing development focus based on popular platforms, architectures, and virtualization systems
* Aiding in troubleshooting and diagnostic processes for better support and stability

All data collected is aggregated and anonymized to ensure individual users cannot be identified.

# 4. Data Retention

The information remains in our self-hosted Plausible instance as long as it remains useful for improving the application, there is no set retention period for the deletion of this data, however Homebox remains dedicated to transparency and openly shares the anonymized usage data collected by our systems publicly for our users to review. 

# 5. User rights and Opt-In Consent

As Homebox is operated around the world, we conform to the relevant laws as applicable in any local jurisdiction. Homebox data is stored and processed in the US, with staff residing in US and UK locations. 

Under both UK and US data protection laws, users have the following rights:

* **Right to opt-in**: Data collection only begins when a user explicitly chooses to share this information.
* **Right to review**: Users can view the publicly accessible analytics to understand how their data contributes to Homebox.
* **Right to withdraw consent**: Users may opt out at any time, stopping any further data collection from their device.

# 6. Policy Changes

Any changes to this privacy policy will be communicated to users through Homebox's update channels (namely Discord or Reddit) **at a minimum** 7 full days prior to any change being conducted (unless mandated by law to do so otherwise).

Continued use of Homebox following updates will imply acceptance of the revised policy, and users are free to opt-out of analytics at any point without impact to their usage of Homebox software.
