# Quick Start

> [!TIP]
> If you're currently running the original version of Homebox ([https://github.com/hay-kot/homebox](https://github.com/hay-kot/homebox)) switching is easy, just follow the instructions in the [Migration Guide](./migration) to switch to the new version.
1. Install Homebox either by using [the latest Docker image](./installation#docker), or by downloading the correct executable for your Operating System from the [Releases](https://github.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox/releases). (See [Installation](./installation) for more details)

2. Browse to `http://SERVER_IP:3100` (if Using Docker) or `http://SERVER_IP:7745` (if installed locally) to access the included web User Interface.

3. Register your first user.

4. Login with the user you just created and start adding your locations and items!

> [!TIP]
> If you want other users to see your items and locations, they will need to sign up using your invite link, otherwise they will only see their own items. Go to the **Profile** section in the left navigation bar and under **User Profile**, click **Generate Invite Link**.
