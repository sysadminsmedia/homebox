# Shadcn-Vue

> [!CAUTION]
> Needs fleshing out

[Shadcn-Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/) is a collection of vue components based on [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). Currently switching to it from daisyui.

## What is shadcn-vue?

To quote shadcn-vue

> This is NOT a component library. It's a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste or use the CLI to add to your apps.
> What do you mean not a component library?
> It means you do not install it as a dependency. It is not available or distributed via npm, with no plans to publish it.
> Pick the components you need. Use the CLI to automatically add the components, or copy and paste the code into your project and customize to your needs. The code is yours.
