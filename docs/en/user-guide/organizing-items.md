# Organizing Your Items

Homebox allows you to organize your items using locations and tags.

## Items

Items represent an item or asset you want to track in Homebox.

To create an item, click on the Create button in the main menu, the select Item / Asset.  The following parameters are available:
- Parent Location (Required) - The location in which the item is stored
- Item Name (Required) - Name of the item
- Item Description (Optional) - Description of the item
- Tags (Optional) - Here, you can add as many Tags to the item as you like for further organization
- Photo (Optional) - Allows you to add a photo of the item. Additional photos can be added after the item has been created.

::: details Additional Fields
Once the item is created, additional fields become available. These are: 

**Details Section**
- Quantity
- Serial Number
- Model Number
- Manufacturer
- Notes
- Insured (Checkbox)
- Archived (Checkbox)
- Asset-ID (Populated by default)

**Purchase Details Section**
- Purchased From
- Purchase Price
- Purchase Date

**Warranty Details Section**
- Lifetime Warranty (Checkbox)
- Warranty Expires
- Warranty Notes

**Sold Details Section**
- Sold to
- Sold Price

::: 

You can also add custom fields by scrolling down to the Custom Fields section and clicking the add button. Custom fields are added on a per-item basis, not globally.

You might want to add attachments to an item (such as photos, a user manual, a warranty, a receipt, etc.) Scroll down to the Attachments section, and either click on the box or drag and drop to add files. Once a file has been added, click edit to edit its details.

> [!TIP]
> To set the primary image (the image that appears in the Search view) for the item, click on the edit button next to the uploaded image and ensure the Primary Photo checkbox is checked. By default, the first photo you upload will automatically be the Primary Photo.


## Locations

*Items* are stored in *locations*. Locations can be nested to create as many locations as you need. Homebox creates some default locations initially, but you can easily change, delete or rearrange them.

To create a location, click the Create button in the main menu, then select Location.

Locations have 3 parameters:
- Name
- Description (Optional)
- Parent Location (Optional -Leave blank if this should be a top-level Location, or select the location you want this location to be nested under)

To view all locations and the items stored in them, select Locations in the main menu.

## Tags

Tags allow you to organize items independently of location. For example, you might have electronic devices all over your house. What if you wanted to see a list of every Electronic Device you own without having to go through every single location?

Tags enable this. In the example above, if you tag all electronic devices with the "Electronics" tag when you create them, you can easily see the list of all your Electronics by going to the related page.

To create a Tag, click the Create button in the menu, then select Tag. Tags have the following parameters:
- Name
- Description (Optional)

To see all items related to a specific tag (or specific combination of tags):
- From the Home page, scroll to the bottom and select the Tag you want to see.
- Alternatively, navigate to the Search page and use the Tags dropdown to filter by one or more tags.

Items can have as many tags as you wish. The example above is only one example of how tags can be used for organization. Experiment with what tags work best for you!
