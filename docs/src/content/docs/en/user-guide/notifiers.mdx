## Configuring Notifiers
### Common Examples

#### Discord

```
discord://webhook_token@webhook_id
```

To get these values:
1. In Discord, go to Server Settings → Integrations → Webhooks
2. Create or edit a webhook
3. Copy the webhook URL: `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/WEBHOOK_ID/WEBHOOK_TOKEN`
4. Format as: `discord://WEBHOOK_TOKEN@WEBHOOK_ID`

#### Slack

```
slack://token@channel
```

Or for webhook URLs:
```
slack://webhook_token@webhook_token_b/webhook_token_c
```

#### Telegram

```
telegram://bot_token@telegram?chats=chat_id
```

#### Email (SMTP)

```
smtp://username:password@host:port/?from=sender@example.com&to=recipient@example.com
```

#### Ntfy

```
ntfy://ntfy.sh/your-topic
```

For self-hosted ntfy:
```
ntfy://your-ntfy.domain.com/your-topic
```

#### Generic Webhook

For custom HTTP webhooks:

```
generic://https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/path
```

Or explicitly specify HTTP method:
```
generic+https://your-webhook-endpoint.com/path
generic+http://your-webhook-endpoint.com/path
```

## Security Considerations for Generic Webhooks

Generic webhooks allow Homebox to make HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs. To prevent Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks and protect your internal network, Homebox provides several configuration options to restrict where generic notifiers can send requests.

:::caution[Security Notice]
Generic webhooks (`generic://`, `generic+https://`, `generic+http://`) can be used to make requests to any accessible network endpoint. Configure the security settings below to protect your internal infrastructure.
:::

### Configuration Options

All security options apply only to generic webhook notifiers. Other notification services (Discord, Slack, etc.) are not affected by these settings.

#### Allow List (Recommended)

The most secure approach is to use an allow list. When configured, **only** the specified networks are allowed, and all block rules are bypassed.

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_ALLOW_NETS="192.168.1.0/24,10.0.50.0/24"
```

**Use Case:** You have specific internal webhook endpoints at known IP ranges and want to only allow those.

#### Block Localhost

Prevents generic notifiers from making requests to localhost/loopback addresses (127.0.0.1, ::1).

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_LOCALHOST=true
```

**Default:** `false`

**Use Case:** Prevent access to services running on the same host as Homebox (e.g., admin panels, development servers).

#### Block Local Networks (RFC1918)

Prevents generic notifiers from making requests to private network ranges:
- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_LOCAL_NETS=true
```

**Default:** `false`

**Use Case:** Block access to all internal network services to prevent SSRF attacks against internal infrastructure.

#### Block Bogon Networks

Prevents generic notifiers from making requests to reserved/special-use IP ranges including:
- Link-local addresses (169.254.0.0/16)
- Multicast addresses
- Broadcast addresses
- Reserved IP ranges
- Documentation/test networks

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_BOGON_NETS=true
```

**Default:** `true` (enabled by default)

**Use Case:** Prevent access to special-use addresses that should never be accessed in production.

#### Block Cloud Metadata Endpoints

Prevents generic notifiers from accessing cloud provider metadata endpoints:
- 169.254.169.254 (AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle Cloud)
- 169.254.169.253 (AWS IMDSv2)
- fd00:ec2::254 (AWS IPv6)

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_CLOUD_METADATA=true
```

**Default:** `true` (enabled by default)

**Use Case:** Critical security measure when running Homebox in cloud environments. Prevents attackers from accessing cloud metadata that often contains sensitive credentials and configuration.

#### Block Specific Networks

Allows you to block specific network ranges using CIDR notation. This provides fine-grained control without needing to enable the blanket `BLOCK_LOCAL_NETS` or `BLOCK_BOGON_NETS` options.

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_NETS="192.168.1.0/24,172.16.0.0/12,10.10.0.0/16"
```

**Default:** (empty, no networks blocked)

**Use Case:** Selectively block specific internal subnets while allowing others. For example:
- Block development/staging environments while allowing production webhook endpoints
- Block specific office networks that shouldn't be accessible
- Enforce organizational security policies that restrict certain network ranges

**Examples:**

Block a single IP:
```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_NETS="192.168.1.100/32"
```

Block multiple networks:
```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_NETS="192.168.0.0/16,172.16.0.0/12,10.10.0.0/16"
```

**Note:** `HBOX_NOTIFIER_ALLOW_NETS` takes precedence over `HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_NETS`. If an IP is in the allow list, it will not be blocked even if it matches a network in the block list.

### Recommended Security Configurations

#### Public Internet Deployment

For Homebox instances accessible from the internet, use strict security settings:

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_LOCALHOST=true
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_LOCAL_NETS=true
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_BOGON_NETS=true
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_CLOUD_METADATA=true
```

#### Internal Network with Specific Webhooks

For internal deployments where you want to allow specific webhook endpoints:

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_ALLOW_NETS="192.168.1.100/32,10.0.20.0/24"
```

Note: When using the allow list, all block rules are bypassed. Only the specified networks will be permitted.

#### Selective Network Blocking

For environments where you want to block specific networks without blocking all private networks:

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_NETS="192.168.1.0/24,10.10.0.0/16"
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_LOCALHOST=true
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_BOGON_NETS=true
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_CLOUD_METADATA=true
```

**Use Case:** You want to allow webhooks to most of your internal network (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8), but block specific subnets like development (10.10.0.0/16) or guest networks (192.168.1.0/24).

#### Development Environment

For development environments where you need more flexibility:

```bash
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_LOCALHOST=false
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_LOCAL_NETS=false
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_BOGON_NETS=true
HBOX_NOTIFIER_BLOCK_CLOUD_METADATA=true
```

## How Notifications Work

### Scheduled Maintenance Reminders

When you create maintenance entries with scheduled dates, Homebox will:

1. Check daily for maintenance scheduled for today
2. For each group with scheduled maintenance, collect all active notifiers
3. Send a notification listing all maintenance items due today
4. Only active notifiers will receive notifications

### Message Format

Notifications are sent in the following format:

```
Homebox Maintenance for (YYYY-MM-DD):
 - Maintenance Item 1
 - Maintenance Item 2
 - Maintenance Item 3
```

## Troubleshooting

### Test Button Fails

If the test button fails:

1. **Check the URL format** - Each service has specific URL format requirements. Refer to the [Shoutrrr documentation](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/v0.8/services/overview/).
2. **Verify credentials** - Ensure tokens, API keys, and passwords are correct
3. **Check security settings** - For generic webhooks, ensure your URL isn't blocked by security configuration
4. **Review logs** - Check Homebox logs for specific error messages

### Notifications Not Being Sent

If scheduled notifications aren't being sent:

1. **Verify the notifier is active** - Toggle the "Active" switch in the notifier configuration
2. **Check maintenance schedule** - Ensure maintenance items have scheduled dates set
3. **Verify date** - Notifications are sent on the scheduled date at the configured time
4. **Check logs** - Review Homebox logs for error messages during notification attempts

### Generic Webhook Blocked

If your generic webhook is being blocked by security settings:

1. **Check the resolved IP** - The target hostname resolves to an IP that's in a blocked range
2. **Review security configuration** - Adjust block settings or use the allow list
3. **Use allow list** - The most reliable way to permit specific endpoints

Example error messages:
- "localhost addresses are blocked"
- "private network addresses (RFC1918) are blocked"
- "bogon/reserved network addresses are blocked"
- "cloud metadata endpoints are blocked"
- "IP X.X.X.X is not in the allowed networks"
