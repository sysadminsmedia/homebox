Items make up the core of Homebox and will make up most of your time entering information into Homebox. Items represent
the actual items that you wish to track and manage within your inventory system. Each item can have various attributes such as name, description,
quantity, location, and any custom fields you may have defined. By managing items effectively, you can keep track of
what you have, where it is located, and other important details. In addition to the text fields, you can also attach images and other files to items.
