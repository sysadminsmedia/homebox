Locations form the basis for organizing your items within Homebox. They represent the physical or logical places where
your items are stored, such as rooms in a house, shelves in a warehouse, or categories in a collection. By defining locations,
you can manage and track where each item is kept. Importantly, Locations can be nested within each other,
allowing for a hierarchical structure that reflects real-world storage systems.
