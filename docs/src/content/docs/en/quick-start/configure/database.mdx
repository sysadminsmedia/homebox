title: Database
---

By default, Homebox will use an SQLite database. This allows for quick setup and works great for smaller installations.
However, you can configure Homebox to use a PostgreSQL database instead. We highly recommend this for larger installations,
as it will allow you to scale Homebox horizontally.

> [!WARNING]
> PostgreSQL is **HIGHLY** recommended if you're using a complex character set language such as Russian, Chinese, etc.
> (basically any language that requires non-ASCII characters) as SQLite has very poor search support for these languages.

## SQLite
This is the default; generally speaking, there is no need to change anything here. We've already configured it with our
recommended settings.

## PostgreSQL
If you’re using docker compose, you can add the following to your `compose.yml` file to get a PostgreSQL database started:
```yaml title="compose.yml"
postgres:
  image: postgres:17-alpine
  restart: unless-stopped
  volumes:
    - postgres:/var/lib/postgresql/data
  environment:
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD: your_secure_password
    POSTGRES_USER: homebox
    POSTGRES_DB: homebox
...
volumes:
...
  postgres:
```

> [!NOTE]
> You should change the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable to a secure password. You can also change the `POSTGRES_USER`
> and `POSTGRES_DB` environment variables to whatever you like.
>
> You may also note that we did not specify a `ports` section, we don't need it as it will automatically be exposed to the Homebox compose network.

Once you have postgres added to your compose file or have made an existing instance accessible to Homebox,
you'll need to add some environment variables to the Homebox service:
- `HBOX_DATABASE_DRIVER=postgres`
- `HBOX_DATABASE_HOST=postgres` (or whatever you named the postgres service in your compose file)
- `HBOX_DATABASE_PORT=5432` (or whatever port you configured postgres to use)
- `HBOX_DATABASE_USERNAME=homebox` (or whatever you set the `POSTGRES_USER` environment variable to)
- `HBOX_DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_secure_password` (or whatever you set the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` environment variable to)
- `HBOX_DATABASE_DATABASE=homebox` (or whatever you set the `POSTGRES_DB` environment variable to)

Optionally, you can also add the following environment variable to the Homebox service:
- `HBOX_DATABASE_SSL_MODE=disable` (disable SSL encryption)
  - Valid options include: `disable`, `require`, `verify-ca`, `verify-full`, the default is `require`
- `HBOX_DATABASE_SSL_ROOT_CERT=path/to/root.crt` (path to the root certificate file)
- `HBOX_DATABASE_SSL_CERT=path/to/server.crt` (path to the server certificate file)
- `HBOX_DATABASE_SSL_KEY=path/to/server.key` (path to the server key file)
