There are two main ways to run Homebox.

1. As a Docker container
2. Using the correct executable for your platform by downloading it from the [releases page](https://github.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox/releases)

> [!NOTE]
> The application can be configured using environment variables. You can find a list of all the available options in the [configuration](/en/quick-start/configure/) section.

> [!TIP]
> We highly recommend using Docker for production deployments. It's easy to setup and it's secure by default. We also
> provide a couple of images with additional security. Additionally, it's the primary way we run Homebox demos and testing.

## Docker
The following instructions assume you have Docker installed on your machine.

The official image is `ghcr.io/sysadminsmedia/homebox:latest`. For each image there are 3 tags, respectively the regular
tag, the `$tag-rootless` and `$tag-hardened`. The rootless tag is a regular image but with the user `homebox` created.
The hardened tag is a distroless image and contains no shells or utilities.

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to use MQTT you must use the regular or rootless image. The hardened image does not contain the MQTT
> client.

### Docker Run
Great for testing the application, but not recommended for production deployments. Checkout the docker compose example below for a production deployment.

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Regular">
        ```bash
        # Run the container
        docker run -d --name homebox --restart unless-stopped \
        --pupblish 3100:7745 --env HBOX_OPTIONS_ALLOW_ANALYTICS=false \
        --volume /path/to/data/folder:/data \
        ghcr.io/sysadminsmedia/homebox:latest
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Rootless">
        ```bash
        # When using rootless you must ensure the data folder has the correct permissions
        mkdir -p /path/to/data/folder
        chown 65532:65532 -R /path/to/data/folder
        # --------
        # Run the container
        docker run -d --name homebox --restart unless-stopped \
        --publish 3100:7745 --env HBOX_OPTIONS_ALLOW_ANALYTICS=false \
        --volume /path/to/data/folder:/data \
        ghcr.io/sysadminsmedia/homebox:latest-rootless
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Hardened">
        ```bash
        # When using hardened you must ensure the data folder has the correct permissions
        mkdir -p /path/to/data/folder
        chown 65532:65532 -R /path/to/data/folder
        # --------
        # Run the container
        docker run -d --name homebox --restart unless-stopped \
        --publish 3100:7745 --env HBOX_OPTIONS_ALLOW_ANALYTICS=false \
        --volume /path/to/data/folder:/data \
        ghcr.io/sysadminsmedia/homebox:latest-hardened
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Docker Compose
1. Create a `compose.yml` file with the following contents:

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Regular">
        ```yaml title="compose.yml"
        services:
            homebox:
                image: ghcr.io/sysadminsmedia/homebox:latest
                restart: always
                environment:
                    - HBOX_LOG_LEVEL=info
                    - HBOX_LOG_FORMAT=text
                    - HBOX_WEB_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=10
                    # Please consider allowing analytics to help us improve Homebox (basic computer information, no personal data)
                    - HBOX_OPTIONS_ALLOW_ANALYTICS=false
                volumes:
                    - homebox-data:/data/
                ports:
                    - 3100:7745

        volumes:
            homebox-data:
                driver: local
        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Rootless">
        ```yaml title="compose.yml"
        services:
            homebox:
                image: ghcr.io/sysadminsmedia/homebox:latest-rootless
                restart: always
                environment:
                    - HBOX_LOG_LEVEL=info
                    - HBOX_LOG_FORMAT=text
                    - HBOX_WEB_MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=10
                    # Please consider allowing analytics to help us improve Homebox (basic computer information, no personal data)
                    - HBOX_OPTIONS_ALLOW_ANALYTICS=false
                volumes:
                    - homebox-data:/data/

        volumes:
            homebox-data:
                driver: local
        ```

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you want to use a bind mount instead of a volume, you will need to `chown` the chosen directory in advance to
        > the `65532` user (as shown in the Docker run example above)
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Hardened">
        ```yaml title="compose.yml"

                volumes:

                ports:

> [!WARNING]
> If you previously set up docker compose with the `HBOX_WEB_READ_TIMEOUT`, `HBOX_WEB_WRITE_TIMEOUT` or `HBOX_WEB_IDLE_TIMEOUT` environment variables,
> with the hay-kot image, please note that you will need to add an `s` for seconds or `m` for minutes to the end of the integers.
> A dependency update removed the default sections, and it now requires them to be explicitly set.
