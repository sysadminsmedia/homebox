## What You Can Do With Homebox

### Core Features
- **Track Everything** – Add items with custom fields, photos, serial numbers, and metadata
- **Location Tracking** – Organize items by location with visual hierarchy
- **Smart Search** – Quickly find items with powerful search and filtering
- **Item Templates** – Create reusable templates with default fields and values
- **Label Management** – Tag and organize items with flexible labels
- **QR Codes** – Generate QR codes for quick item lookup
- **Bill of Materials** – Export comprehensive BOMs for your inventory

### Power User Features
- **OIDC SSO** – Integrate with your existing identity provider (Active Directory, Okta, etc.)

## Why Not Use Something Else?

### Spreadsheet
Spreadsheets work fine for small inventories but become unwieldy with lots of data. You lose out on search capabilities, can't easily attach photos or documents, and sharing becomes complicated. Spreadsheets also don't support features like location hierarchies, templates, or QR codes.

### Snipe-IT
Snipe-IT is enterprise-grade IT asset management – fantastic if you're managing hundreds of IT devices across an organization. But for home users, it's overkill. You'll spend more time configuring than organizing. HomeBox is purpose-built for home users: simpler, faster, and designed for the way you actually manage your stuff.
