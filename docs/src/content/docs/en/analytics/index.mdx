title: Purpose & Data
---

We collect non-identifying information from users of Homebox that have opted in to analytics collection. By default, users do not send us anything, however, once opted in, that data gets sent to our own Plausibe instance, and the data below is live from that instance.

We make this data public so that exactly what's being collected is always available for review. This keeps us honest and transparent about what we collect.
