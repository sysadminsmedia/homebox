title: Getting started
---
The Homebox project welcomes contributions from developers of all skill levels. Whether you're a seasoned open-source
contributor or new to the world of collaborative software development, our guides will help you get started.

We welcome contributions of all kinds, including documentation, bug reports, feature requests, code, translations, or even
just monetary support.

## Next steps
We highly recommend reading the [Code of Conduct](/en/contribute/code-of-conduct) before contributing. We expect all
contributors to abide by it. Failure to do so may result in a permanent ban from the project. We will not tolerate any
form of harassment or discrimination.

### Contributing Code
To contribute code, please read our [development guide](/en/contribute/development). We've made significant effort to make the process as easy as
possible. Not only do we have the documentation for the dependencies, tooling, etc. that you'll need, but we've also made
heavy documentation of internal architecture designs and design decisions that you can use as a reference.

### Contributing Translations
We welcome contributions to our translations! If you're interested in helping translate Homebox into other languages,
please read our [translation guide](/en/contribute/translate). We accept translations for our documentation and user-facing
strings.

### Contributing Documentation
We welcome contributions to our documentation! If you're interested in helping improve our documentation, you can get started
by reading our [documentation guide](/en/contribute/documentation). We use [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) to generate our documentation, so you'll
need a basic understanding of Markdown and Starlight syntax.

### Reporting Bugs
If you've found a bug in Homebox, please report it by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox/issues).

### Suggesting Enhancements
We accept feature requests through our [GitHub repository discussions board](https://github.com/sysadminsmedia/homebox/discussions/categories/ideas).

### Other Ways to Contribute
We also welcome contributions in other ways, such as sponsoring our development efforts or helping us promote Homebox.
