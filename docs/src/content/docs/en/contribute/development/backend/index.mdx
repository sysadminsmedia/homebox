Homebox is a complex application with a lot of moving parts. This page will give you an overview of the
backend codebase structure to help you get started with development. We hope that this document will help you understand the
architecture of the backend and help you get started with development.

## Task Commands To Know
There are several invaluable Task commands that you'll need to know to get started with development. A few of them you'll
need to run everytime before submitting a PR.

- `task generate` - generates OpenAPI docs and JS types (run this EVERY time before submitting a PR)
- `task go:lint` - runs linters (run this EVERY time before submitting a PR)
- `task go:run` - runs the backend server locally with sqlite
- `task go:run:postgres` - runs the backend server locally with postgres
- `task go:test` - runs backend tests
