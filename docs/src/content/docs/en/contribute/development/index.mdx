You will need several tools and dependencies to work on Homebox.
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation)

Once you have these tools and dependencies installed, you can run `task setup` to install package dependencies and the remaining
required tools.

Homebox is split into two parts:
- Backend
- Frontend

## Backend
The backend is written in Go and is located in the `backend` directory. The backend is a REST API that exposes
all of the functionality of Homebox. The backend is responsible for managing the database, handling authentication,
and serving the frontend. It can also be used by 3rd party applications to interact with Homebox.

Extensive backend documentation can be found in the [backend topic](/en/contribute/development/backend).

## Frontend
The frontend is written in VueJS with Vite and Nuxt and is located in the `frontend` directory. The frontend is a
 single-page application that provides a user interface for interacting with Homebox. It is built on top of the
[Homebox API](/docs/api).

Extensive frontend documentation can be found in the [frontend topic](/en/contribute/development/frontend).
