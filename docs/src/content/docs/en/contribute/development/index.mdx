You will need several tools and dependencies to work on Homebox.
- [Go](https://go.dev/dl/)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation)

Once you have these tools and dependencies installed, you can run `task setup` to install package dependencies and the remaining
required tools.

Homebox is split into two parts:
- Backend
- Frontend

## Backend
The backend is written in Go and is located in the `backend` directory. The backend is a REST API that exposes
all the functionality of Homebox. The backend is responsible for managing the database, handling authentication,
and serving the frontend. It can also be used by 3<sup>rd</sup> party applications to interact with Homebox.

Extensive backend documentation can be found in the [backend topic](/en/contribute/development/backend).

## Frontend
The frontend is written in VueJS with Vite and Nuxt and is located in the `frontend` directory. The frontend is a
 single-page application that provides a user interface for interacting with Homebox. It is built on top of the
[Homebox API](/docs/api).

Extensive frontend documentation can be found in the [frontend topic](/en/contribute/development/frontend).

## Running Locally
To run Homebox locally, for development purposes, you'll need to run both the backend and frontend. You can run them in two separate terminals:
- `task go:run`
- `task ui:dev`

This will start both the backend and frontend locally. The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`, and will
automatically proxy API request to the backend at `http://localhost:7745`.
