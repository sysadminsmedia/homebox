import {Steps, Tabs, TabItem, Aside} from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import {Icon} from "astro-icon/components";

Our documentation uses [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and MDX pages. This guide will help you get started with contributing to the documentation.

## Initial Setup

<Steps>
    1. Fork our repository on GitHub. (You can click the edit button on the bottom left of this page to do this.)
    2. Clone your fork to your local machine.
    3. `cd` into the `docs` directory and run `pnpm install`.
    4. Run `pnpm run dev` to start the development server.
</Steps>

## Development Server

Once you've installed dependencies, you can start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

The documentation site will be available at `http://localhost:3000`. The development server automatically reloads when you make changes to files.

## Project Structure

The documentation follows a standard Astro/Starlight structure:

- **`src/`** - Source files for the documentation
  - **`content/docs/`** - Documentation pages organized by language (e.g., `en/`, `es/`)
  - **`components/`** - Reusable Astro components and custom theme overrides
  - **`assets/`** - Images, SVGs, and other static assets
  - **`content.config.ts`** - Content collections configuration
- **`public/`** - Static files served as-is
- **`astro.config.mjs`** - Astro configuration with Starlight and plugin settings

## Writing Documentation

### File Format

Documentation pages are written in MDX (Markdown with JSX support). Create new files in the appropriate directory under `src/content/docs/en/` (or other language codes).

### Frontmatter

Every documentation page must start with frontmatter that defines metadata:

```markdown
---
title: Page Title
description: A brief description of the page
sidebar:
  order: 1
---
```

Common frontmatter options:
- **`title`** - Page title (required)
- **`description`** - Meta description for SEO
- **`sidebar`** - Sidebar configuration (order, label, etc.)
- **`draft`** - Set to `true` to hide the page from navigation

### Using Starlight Components

Starlight provides several built-in components you can use in your MDX:

#### Steps

Use the `<Steps>` component for numbered instructions:

```jsx
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Steps>
    1. First step here
    2. Second step here
    3. Third step here
</Steps>
```
##### Output
<Steps>
    1. First step here
    2. Second step here
    3. Third step here
</Steps>

#### Tabs

Use the `<Tabs>` component to show content in tabs:

```jsx
import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Option A">
        Content for Option A
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Option B">
        Content for Option B
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>
```

###### Output
<Tabs>
    <TabItem label="Option A">
        Content for Option A
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Option B">
        Content for Option B
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Aside (Notes, Tips, Warnings)

Use the `<Aside>` component for callout boxes:

```jsx
import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Aside type="note">
    This is a note with additional information.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
    This is a helpful tip.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
    This is a caution or warning.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
    This is critical information.
</Aside>
```

##### Output
<Aside type="note">
    This is a note with additional information.
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
    This is a helpful tip.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
    This is a caution or warning.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
    This is critical information.
</Aside>

You can also use the Github-style alert syntax:

```markdown
> [!Note]
> This is a note with additional information.

> [!Tip]
> This is a helpful tip.

> [!Important]
> This is a caution or warning.

> [!Caution]
> This is critical information.
```

##### Output
> [!Note]
> This is a note with additional information.

> [!Tip]
> This is a helpful tip.

> [!Important]
> This is important information.

> [!Caution]
> This is a caution or warning.

#### Code Blocks

Use standard Markdown code blocks with syntax highlighting:

````markdown
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```
````

##### Output
```bash
pnpm run dev
```

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

You can add a filename and highlight specific lines:

````markdown
```javascript title="src/components/MyComponent.astro" {2,4}
const greeting = "Hello";
const name = "World";
console.log(greeting, name);
```
````
##### Output
```javascript title="src/components/MyComponent.astro" {2,4}
const greeting = "Hello";
const name = "World";
console.log(greeting, name);
```

#### Icons

Use the `<Icon />` component from `astro-icon` to add icons:

```jsx
import { Icon } from 'astro-icon/components'

<Icon name="simple-icons:github" />
```

##### Output
<Icon name="simple-icons:github" />

> [!Note]
> The Icons must be added to the `astro.config.mjs` file to be rendered. We force this to reduce the bundle size of the documentation.

### Images and Assets

Store images in `src/assets/` and reference them in your MDX:

```jsx
import { Image } from 'astro:assets'
import myImage from '../../../assets/my-image.png'

<Image src={myImage} alt="Description of the image" />
```

Or use relative image paths:

```markdown
![Alt text](../../../assets/my-image.png)
```

## Navigation and Sidebar

The sidebar is automatically generated based on the file structure and frontmatter. To customize the sidebar order, use the `sidebar.order` property in frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: My Page
sidebar:
  order: 1
---
```

For grouping pages into sections, organize them in subdirectories. The sidebar will automatically group files by directory.

## Localization

Our documentation supports multiple languages. Each language has its own directory under `src/content/docs/`:

- `en/` - English
- `es/` - Spanish
- `fr/` - French
- And many others...

To add documentation in another language, create a new language directory and follow the same structure as the English documentation. Use the language code (e.g., `de` for German) as the directory name.

You can read more about localizing the documentation in our [documentation translation guide](/en/contribute/translate/documentation/).

## Plugins and Extensions

Our Starlight setup includes several plugins:

- **starlight-theme-nova** - Custom theme styling
- **starlight-github-alerts** - GitHub-style alerts support
- **starlight-changelogs** - Changelog management
- **starlight-openapi** - OpenAPI documentation integration
- **starlight-sidebar-topics** - Sidebar organization

These plugins provide additional features and customization options.

## Building and Deployment

To build the documentation for production:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

To preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm run preview
```

The built site will be in the `dist/` directory.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it clear and concise** – Use short sentences and clear language
- **Use examples** – Provide code examples and real-world use cases
- **Add metadata** – Always include proper frontmatter with descriptions
- **Check links** - Ensure all internal and external links are valid
- **Use appropriate components** – Leverage Starlight components for better readability
- **Consistent formatting** – Follow the existing documentation style
- **Mobile-friendly** - Starlight is responsive by default, but test on mobile
- **Preview changes** – Use the dev server to preview your changes before committing

## Styling with Tailwind CSS

The documentation uses Tailwind CSS through `@astrojs/starlight-tailwind`. Custom CSS can be added in `src/styles/` and imported in your MDX files or Astro components.

## Troubleshooting

### Dev server not starting
- Make sure you've run `pnpm install` in the `docs` directory
- Check that port 3000 is not in use
- Try deleting `node_modules/` and `.astro/` and reinstalling

### Changes not reflecting
- The dev server should auto-reload, but try stopping and restarting it
- Clear your browser cache if styles aren't updating

### Build errors
- Check for syntax errors in MDX files
- Ensure all imports are correct
- Run `pnpm run build` to see full error messages
