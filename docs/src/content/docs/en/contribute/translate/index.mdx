Depending on your experience with translation and open source contribution, there are different ways to get started with
translating the Homebox project.

If you just want something simple, you can do it from your browser, you can easily translate the actual application via
[our Weblate instance](https://translate.sysadminsmedia.com).

> [!NOTE]
> If you add a new language, please make sure to add a new key to the english language that looks like this:
> `languages.<weblatelangcode>` with the english word for that language.
>
> As an example, `languages.fr` would be `French` in the english language. While a region-specific one might be `languages.fr-CA`
> for `French (Canada)`. Each language can then translate this key to their respective language.
>
> Without this key, the language name will not be displayed correctly in any language.

To translate the documentation, please see the [documentation translation guide](/docs/en/contribute/translate/docs).
