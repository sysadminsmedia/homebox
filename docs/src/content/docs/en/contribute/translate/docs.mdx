title: Docs

Homebox uses MDX files for its documentation, which allows us to write content using Markdown syntax while also embedding
Astro/VueJS components when needed. This documentation contains the specific information to help you contribute to the
translation of the documentation. For a more general overview on contributing to documentation, check the [overview](/docs/en/contribute/documentation).

## Translating the docs
The documentation is stored in the `docs/src/content/docs` folder of the repository. Each language has its own folder
inside that folder, for example, the English documentation is in `docs/src/content/docs/en`. To add a new language, create
a new folder inside that folder with the language code. For example, to add Spanish documentation, create a folder called
`es` inside the `docs/src/content/docs/` folder.

Once you've created the folder, you will need to add the new language to the `docs/astro.config.mjs` file. You can find the
`locales` property roughly on line 177 of that file.

```js
locales: {
    en: {
        label: 'English',
    },
    ...
},
```

You'll note that you need to add a property that matches the language code you created for the new folder. And then add a
subproperty called `label` with the name of the language as it will be displayed in the UI.

> [!NOTE]
> We highly recommend using the ISO 639-1 language code for the language code. And we recommend using the native name of the language.
> (e.g. `es` for Español, `fr` for Français, etc.)

Additionally, under the `starlightSidebarTopics` config, in the items section you can add translations to the sidebar menu items.

```js
starlightSidebarTopics([
    {
        label: { en: 'Documentation', es: 'Documentación' },
        link: '/quick-start/',
        icon: 'open-book',
        items: [
            {
                label: 'Getting Started',
                translate: [
                    es: 'Guía de Iniciación',
                ],
                items: [
                    {
                        label: 'Quick Start',
                        slug: 'quick-start',
                    },
                    ...
```

This will need to be repeated for all labels

Note that sidebar menu items that are generated from the folder contents will be translated via the `title` attribute of frontmatter.

## Translating UI Elements
UI elements can be translated by adding a `<lang>.json` file to the `docs/src/content/i18n/` folder. For example,
to add Spanish translations, create a file called `es.json` in that folder.

From there you can copy the keys from the English file and translate them into the language of your choice.

## What if I don't Translate All the Pages?
If you don't translate all the pages, the UI will fall back to English, with a warning at the top informing the end reader
that the page has not been translated yet.

### What if I only translated part of a page?
Please only submit fully translated pages. Partial translations will result in missing content for the end user, which is not
desired. We will do our best to avoid accepting partial translations.
